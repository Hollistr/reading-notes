## What is CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages. CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.

## CSS Syntax
CSS is a rule-based language — you define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page. CSS properties have different allowable values, depending on which property is being specified.

## CSS Modules
As there are so many things that you could style using CSS, the language is broken down into modules. Many of the documentation pages are organized around a particular module.

## CSS Specifications
Is developed by a group within the W3C called the CSS Working Group. This group is made of representatives of browser vendors and other companies who have an interest in CSS.

## Browser Support Information
After a CSS feature has been specified, then it is only useful for us in developing web pages if one or more browsers have implemented the feature. This means that the code has been written to turn the instruction in our CSS file into something that can be output to the screen.
