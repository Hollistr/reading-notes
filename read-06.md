## What is JavaScript

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries.

## 3 Major Parts

We can distinguish 3 major parts of what we usually refer to as "JavaScript".
1.	The language itself. This is fairly standard among the various environments, both in the various browsers and in the various server-side environments.
2.	The DOM API - how the language can interact with the various parts of a web page while in the browser. While in this respect the various browsers are getting closer to each other they still differ. Several libraries, most prominently JQuery, is trying to provide a unified API.
3.	The server API (or just API) provided by Node.js or one of the other server-side systems.
