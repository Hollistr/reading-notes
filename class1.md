# Class 1 Reading Notes

## Basic Markdown Writing

### Headings
To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. For example, to create a heading level three (<h3>), use three number signs (e.g., ### My Header).
### Paragraphs
Unless the paragraph is in a list, don’t indent paragraphs with spaces or tabs.
###Line Breaks
You can use two or more spaces (commonly referred to as “trailing whitespace”) for line breaks in nearly every Markdown application, but it’s controversial
### Emphasis
You can add emphasis by making text bold or italic.
### Bold
To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.
### Bold and Italic
To emphasize text with bold and italics at the same time, add three asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase.
### Block Quotes
To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.
### Ordered Lists
To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods.
### Unordered Lists
To create an unordered list, add dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items. Indent one or more items to create a nested list.
