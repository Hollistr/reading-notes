## Control Flow

The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.

## Functions

Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output.

## Defining Functions

A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
•	The name of the function.
•	A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
•	The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { /* … */ }.
